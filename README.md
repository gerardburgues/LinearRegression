# LinearRegression

This project consist in applying a regression model given a data set. 

First of all, we will analyse the given data set and learn what this data is providing to us. We will show some plots reflecting the most important.
Secondly, we will start with the regression, we will calculate the medium quadratic error, determining what is the rror between the prediction and the real value, finding the smallest.
